# Neuro-Symbolic Validation with Temporal Constraints (Re-used from [this github](https://github.com/SoulardThibaut/TemporalConstraints))

## Overview

This directory contains the source code for our neuro-symbolic validation approach, which leverages temporal constraints for fact validation. This method was the subject of our previous work and is included here to be evaluated on this new benchmark.

The approach combines learned embeddings with symbolic reasoning to assess the temporal plausibility of facts.

## How to Run

* **Execution**: The main script to launch a full experimental run is `FullScript.py`.

* **Results**: All output files, including logs and evaluation metrics, will be generated and stored in the `Outputs_work/` directory.
